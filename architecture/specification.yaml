### OVERALL UI ARCHITECTURE

#
# views: Each view shows a different set of records (before filtering on geo or metadata).
#        The records for each view may have a different set of fields, though ideally some will be overlapping so that
#        at least some filters can be "carried over" when switching between views.
#        
# markers: A set of available/allowed marker classes is configured per view.
#          All views must have at least one marker type configured.  Markers will always be
#          semantically zoomed according to either geohash_x fields or some other fields (e.g. country, adm1, adm2).
#          Markers that need special data (e.g. data specific to chromosomal inversions) need
#          marker-type-specific data service endpoints.
#
# panels: A set of available/allowed panel classes is configured per view.
#         Example panels would be "details table" or "stacked timeline plot" or "download CSV"
#         Panels are responsible for requesting their own data, but have access to application-wide filters.
#         Panels should ideally offer the choice of displaying data for
#         a) the current selected marker(s)
#         b) the current visible markers (in the viewport)
#         c) all data matching the current metadata-based filters
#         d) all data
#
# At a time, one view, one marker type and one panel can be active.  We are thinking of putting
# these in the URL (single page application with forward/backward history).
#
# "Page" URLs could therefore be
#
#  /view/ViewName/marker/MarkerType/panel/PanelType?other=params
#
# or more simply
#
#  /ViewName/MarkerType/PanelType?other=params
#
# however, the more verbose URL scheme might allow for more complex behaviour in
# future (e.g. multiple markers active at once: /view/ViewName/markers/MarkerType1/MarkerType2/panel/PanelType?other=params )
#
# The data service (see https://github.com/bobular/mapveu-rest-prototype) also a /view/ViewName prefix to its endpoint URLs.
# Which means that /view/Sample/marker/RecordCount/markerData should return different data compare to
# /view/Genotype/marker/RecordCount/markerData
#
#
# filters:
#
#  geo-based: viewport bounding box, current selected marker(s) and or drawn polygons - referred to as SELECTIONS
#             all geo-based filters use geo fields
#
#  metadata-based: e.g. species=Anopheles gambiae, date="2002 to 2005"                - referred to as FILTERS
#
# field names: The 'species' and 'date' field names in the filter examples above will be configured per view.
#              For a given field, there could be a display field and a search field.  The display field
#              might be single-valued string-type (in terms of Solr faceting behaviour) while the search
#              field could be multi-valued and contain parent ontology terms, synoyms etc.
#

### UI ELEMENTS

#
# isCore: would this element exist in a map with no plugins configured?
#

the-map:
  description:
    The main zoomable map, handled by Leaflet.js.  Usually full-screen, but not necessarily.
  isCore: true
  events:
    navigating:
      description: user is zooming, panning, or resizing their browser window
      emits: MOVING_OR_ZOOMING(), CLEAR_SELECTION()  (maybe both not needed)
    finished_navigating:
      description: user has finished navigating
      emits: MOVED_OR_ZOOMED(new bbox)
    click_in_map:
      description: user clicks in the map, NOT on a marker or any other element
      emits: CLEAR_SELECTION()
    drawn_polygon:
      description: user has drawn a rectangle or polygon to make a selection
      emits: REPLACE_SELECTION(polgon)
    add_drawn_polygon:
      description: user has drawn a shape with CTRL key (or equivalent) pressed because they want to add to previous
      emits: ADD_TO_SELECTION(polygon)
    remove_drawn_polygon:
      description: user cancels previously drawn polygon
      emits: REMOVE_DRAWN_POLYGON(polygon)
      notes:
        Will the polygon persist as an element/component on the map? Probably.
        In that case the polygon will be its own element, and this event will be handled
	by that, not 'the-map'.
      

the-markers:
  description:
    A layer of clickable markers (could be circles, polygons, rectangles, depending on marker plugin/class).
    To start with, just one layer would be shown. Still thinking about whether or not to have multiple layers
    of markers (if they are visibly different perhaps it's OK).  Another thing we will add is multiple
    layers of continuous data (e.g. climate, land use) shown as semi-transparent bitmap or vector graphics.
  isCore: false  # though map will ship with basic markers
  consumes: markerData

a-marker:
  description: one marker from the-markers
  isCore: false
  consumes: markerData
  events:
    click:
      description: user clicks normally on a marker
      emits: REPLACE_SELECTION(polygon)   # technically the payload could be a polygon
                                          # (bounding box of the marker's aggregated data) or
                                          # a filter on the aggregating field, e.g. geohash_x:abc or country:Mali
					  # It might be simpler to keep it all geometry based.
    ctrl-click:
      description: user is adding (or removing if already selected) another marker to the selection
      emits: ADD_TO_SELECTION(polygon) or REMOVE_FROM_SELECTION(polygon)
  notes:
    Need to thrash out the mechanics of adding and removing markers from a multi-selection.
    Does a marker itself know if it's selected?  Or does the central state management keep track?
  

marker-selector:
  description:
    Allows the user to choose which type of marker (from those configured for this view) to use
  isCore: true

stacked-timeline-plot:
  description:
    Another example of a panel that may only be available in some views.
  isCore: false
  consumes: panels.stackedTimelinePlot.timelineData

stacked-timeline-plot-ui:
  description: UI for setting the date resolution for the timeline plot
  isCore: false

active-filters:
  description:
    The place where currently active filters (on date and/or metadata but not on geolocation) are displayed.
